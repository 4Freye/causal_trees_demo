    "## Dataset Overview: RCT of Indomethacin for Prevention of Post-ERCP Pancreatitis\n",
    "\n",
    "### TLDR\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from a RCT trial. The question of this trial is does indomethacin (the treatment) prevent PEP (the outcome variable) after a medical procedure known as ERCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "This dataset originates from a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective 2-arm trial designed to investigate whether rectal indomethacin (100 mg) can prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram, is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat conditions involving the pancreas and bile ducts. However, it carries a significant risk of complications, with post-ERCP pancreatitis being one of the most common and severe outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The trial, published in the *New England Journal of Medicine* in 2012 by Elmunzer, Higgins, et al., enrolled 602 participants across multiple centers. It aimed to assess the effectiveness of indomethacin in reducing the occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis compared to a placebo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Variables\n",
    "- **Identifier variables**: `id` (subject id) and `site` (where the experiment took place)\n",
    "- **Outcome Variable (Y):** The occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis (`outcome`, factor: 0_no, 1_yes).\n",
    "- **Treatment Variable (W):** The treatment arm (`rx`, factor: 0_placebo, 1_indomethacin).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study Design\n",
    "This dataset is derived from a **randomized controlled trial (RCT)**. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a treatment group receiving rectal indomethacin (100 mg) or a placebo group. The primary outcome was the rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis, with secondary analyses exploring risk factors and safety concerns, such as gastrointestinal bleeding.\n",
